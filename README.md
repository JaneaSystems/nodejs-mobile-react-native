# Podspecs for The Node.js for Mobile Apps React Native plugin

This repo is a fork from janeasystems/nodejs-mobile-react-native and the only difference is that we are adding a podspec file, so as we can install the native module through cocoapods. 

For more info about how to use `nodejs-mobile-react-native` please refer to their [main repo](https://github.com/janeasystems/nodejs-mobile-react-native).

For more info on how to install this package through CocoaPods please refer to the [CocoaPod codebase](https://github.com/jgtoriginal/RNNodeJsMobile)
